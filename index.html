      Established in May 27 1996 the Salmon family started an empire with their salmon shaped/flavored cookies. Many people compare Pat Salmon with the greats such as Ronald McDonald and Walt Disney. Not only does Pat Salmon run his empire but he also runs a nice family that support his ideas and help accomplish them. R Salmons' main reason for pursuing this dream was Drakes' line, <em>"F*** being rich when I'm 40 I'm tryna make it now."</em>
